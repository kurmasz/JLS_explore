<h2>Sign Extension</h2>
</center>

<p>
A single "wire" (a line) connecting elements can represent one wire or a bundle of wires.
The bundle element allows you to create a wire bundle from existing single
wires or smaller bundles.
The unbundle elements allows you to break up a bundle into various
combinations of wires and bundles.

<p>
To demonstrate this, we'll construct a subcircuit that has a single 16-bit
input, assumed to represent a 16-bit two's complement binary number, and a
single 32-bit output which will equal the same number being input as a 32-bit
two's complement number.
To do so we need sign extend the 16-bit input to 32 bits.

<p>
To do this in JLS we need to do three things:
<ol>
<li>
Unbundle the 16-bit input into two parts: a single-bit (the sign bit)
and the lower 15 bits.
<li>
Make 17 copies of the sign bit.
<li>
Bundle the 17 copies of the sign bit with the lower 15 bits from the input.
</ol>

<p>
Here's what the circuit will look like when we are done:
<p>

<p>
Let's assume this will be a subcircuit, so first create the 16-bit input pin
and the 32-bit output pin.
Then select the unbundle element from the toolbar (it looks like a left set
brace with three dots).
When the create dialog appears first set the number of bits to 16.

<p>
Now we need to choose between unbundling the single 16-bit input wire into 16
separate single output wires, or to group the output wires.
You might want to try the first option just to see what happens - if you do,
then just delete the element you get and start over.

<p>
Select the "Group Bits" option and then click the "OK" button.
You will get a new dialog with all the input bit numbers on the left and an
area to show the output groupings on the right.
We need two outputs: bit 15 (the sign) and bits 14-0 (the rest).
Since the input bits are shown from 0 on top to 15 on the bottom, we'll create
the 15-bit output first.

<p>
To select a group (range), you first need to click on one of the bits
(high or low), then hold the shift key down and click on the other one.
Since our range is 14-0, and since bit 0 is already selected (highlighted),
all you need to do is scroll down to bit 14, hold the shift key down, and click
on 14.
This will cause the entire group to become highlighted.
If this doesn't happen you probably forgot to hold down the shift key.

<p>
To make the selection "official", now click on the "&gt;&gt;&gt;" button just
to the right.
When you do so the bit range (group) just selected is now shown in the "chosen"
box.
(You can remove a bit range from the chosen side by clicking on it and then
clicking on the "&lt;&lt;&lt;" button.)
Now return to the input bits and click on bit 15, then on the "&gt;&gt;&gt;"
button.
The chosen box should now show 14-0 and 15 as the chosen outputs.
Click on OK and then connect the input of the new element to the output of
the "Input" pin.

<p>
Next we have to make 17 copies of bit 15.
Select the bit copy elements from the toolbar (it looks like a left square
bracket with two dots and a right set brace and is right under the output
pin element in the toolbar).
Set the number of bits to 17 and click on OK, then place the element a short
distance away from the unbundle element you created previously.
Connect output bit 15 of the unbundle element to the input of the bit copy
element with a wire.

<p>
Finally we need to bundle the remaining 15 bits from the unbundle element
with the 17 bits from the bit copy element.
Select the bundle element from the toolbar (it is just to the right of the
unbundle element).
Set the number of bits to 32, pick the "Group Bits" option, and click on OK.
This time the bit groups we want are 14-0 (from the unbundle element) and
15-31 (from the bit copy element).
This works just like the unbundle element, so click on bit 0 then hold the
shift key down and click on bit 14, then click on "&gt;&gt;&gt;" to choose it.
Then do likewise for bits 31-15.
When you are done the chosen box should show the two desired ranges.
Click on OK and place the element so that the output of the new bundle element
is connected to the input of the "Output" pin.

<p>
To complete the circuit, draw wires between the 0-14 output of the unbundle
element to the 14-0 input of the bundle element, and between the output of the
bit copy element to the 31-15 input of the bundle element.

<p>
That completes this tutorial, but here's something about the unbundle element
that can be very useful.
The unbundle element can create different outputs that have overlapping inputs.
For example, a 3-bit input (bits 0, 1 and 2) could be unbundled into all (or
any combination) of the outputs: 0, 1, 2, 1-0, 2-1, 2-0.
A particular common use of this feature would be to unbundle an encoded
CPU instruction word into various fields when there are multiple instruction
formats (i.e., the bits in the instruction mean different things depending
on the op-code).
