<p>
The keypad is a convenient way to input a number without having to move your
hand to the keyboard. Numbers are input by simply clicking on keypad digits.

<p>
The keypad is available whenever a down-pointing triangle (<img src=down.gif>)
appears to the right of a numeric input field.
It can be made visible by clicking on the triangle.
Then simply click on the digits as needed. Clicking on "C" in the keypad will
clear the inputs box.
Clicking on the upward pointing
triangle (<img src=up.gif>) in the keypad will hide the keypad.
Clicking on the down-pointing triangle will hide
the keypad, as will right clicking anywhere in the keypad area.

<p>
ome input fields can take numbers only in base 10, but some can use base 2
(binary), 10 or 16 (hexadecimal). When base 16 is possible, the keypad will
include "digits" a-f.
When base 2 is chosen, only the 0 and 1 keypad buttons will work.
When base 10 is chosen, only buttons 0-9 will work.
When base 16 is chosen, all buttons will work, including a-f.
