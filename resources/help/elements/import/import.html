<h1>Subcircuits</h1>

<p>
Subcircuits are ordinary JLS circuits that are imported into other circuits.
The imported circuits use
<a href=../wiring/input.html>input</a>
and
<a href=../wiring/output.html>output</a>
pin elements to allow them to be connected to wires in the circuit they are
imported into.

<p>
Circuits that are currently open in JLS (i.e., have a tab showing) can be
imported into the currently visible circuit by pulling down the import list
at the far right of the toolbar, then choosing and placing the desired
subcircuit.

<p>
To import a circuit that is not open in JLS (i.e., a circuit file), use
the <a ../../menus/file/import.html>import menu item</a> in the <b>File</b>
menu.

<p>
Give the new subcircuit a name, then click on <font color=green>OK</font>
to begin placing the subcircuit element, or on <font color=pink>Cancel</font>
to cancel it.

<p>
The subcircuit just imported will be a <b>copy</b> of the original circuit.
Hence any changes made to the copy will not be reflected in the original
circuit, nor in any other imported copies of the circuit.
