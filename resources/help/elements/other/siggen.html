<h1>Signal Generator</h1>

<p>
This element generates one or more complex signals that are sent to
input pins of the circuit during simulation.

<p>
Signals are specified using a simple textual form
(<a href=sigformat.html>format</a>).

<p>
Enter the signal specification, then
click on <font color=green>OK</font> to place the element,
or <font color=pink>Cancel</font> to cancel.

<p>
Only one signal generator can appear in a given circuit.

<p>
If the circuit a signal generator appears in is imported, the signal
generator is made inoperaable.
Hence a signal generator can be put into a subcircuit for testing
purposes before it is imported without it affecting the subcircuit when it
is eventually imported.
