<h1>Input Pin</h1>

<p>
An input pin is has three purposes.

<ul>
<li>
It is used in circuits that will be imported into other circuits as a place
for the importing circuit to connect to.
When a circuit is imported it will appear as a box in the editor with
input connection points as specified by input pins in the imported circuit.

<li>
It is used by a signal generator as a place to send signals to.
This is useful when testing a circuit.

<li>
It can be <i>watched</i> by the simulator to provide a signal trace.
</ul>

To create an input pin, select the 
<img src=../../../edu/mtu/cs/jls/images/ipin.gif> icon from the toolbar.

<p>
Give the pin a name and set the number of bits it represents by typing the
number in the <b>bits</b> area or using the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>.

<p>
To finish the dialog and place the newly created pin, click on the
<font color=green>OK</font> button.
Then move the mouse to position the pin where you want it in the circuit
and left click to fix it in that position (it can be moved later, so don't
have to be in exactly the right spot).

<p>
If you change your mind and decide you don't want a pin, click on the
<font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font> button in the dialog.
If you have already clicked on the <font color=green>OK</font> button but
have not yet fixed the place of the new pin, you can still cancel it
by right clicking the mouse.
