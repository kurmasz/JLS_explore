<h1>Wires</h1>

<p>
Wires connect logic elements.
In JLS, a wire is represented by a single line in a circuit drawing.
A wire bundle is multiple wires represented by a single line in a circuit
drawing, and is created automatically when a new wire is attached to a
multi-bit input or output of a logic element or to an existing wire bundle
(see also <a href=bundle.html>bundling</a> and
<a href=unbundle.html>unbundling</a>).
