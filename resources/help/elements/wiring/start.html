<h1>Naming a Wire</h1>

<p>
Circuits can become very messy when wires must extend long distances
and cross many other wires.
To avoid such situations, you can give a named point to a wire,
then <i>virtually</i> connect other wires to the named point.

<p>
A <i>wire start</i> names and visually terminates a wire or
<a href=bundle.html>wire bundle</a>.
A <i>wire end</i> begins a new wire (or bundle) that is logically,
but not visually, connected to a corresponding wire start.

<p>
To create a wire start, select the
<img src=../../../edu/mtu/cs/jls/images/jumpstart.gif>icon from the toolbar,
give the wire a name, set the number of bits in the wire (bundle) by entering
a number or using the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>, and clicking on the
<font color=green>OK</font> button (click on the
<font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font> button to cancel the creation of the wire
start).

<p>
Place the wire start and connect it to a wire or the output of some element.
Now you can create one or more <a href=end.html>wire ends</a> connected to
this wire start.
