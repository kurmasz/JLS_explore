<h1>Bundling Wires</h1>

<p>
A wire bundle is a single line in the circuit drawing that corresponds to
multiple single wires.

<p>
Bundles are created automatically when you create a wire that connects
to a multi-bit input or output of an element, or to another wire bundle.

<p>
You can create a bundle from a collection of individual wires, and/or other
wire bundles, by creating a wire bundling element.
To do so, pick the
<img src=../../../edu/mtu/cs/jls/images/bind.gif> icon from the toolbar,
then pick the number of bits that you want in the new bundle.

<p>
If all the wires that will form the bundle are single wires, then select
the <b>Single Bits</b> option.
If some of them are already bundles, then pick the </b>Group Bits</b> option.
Then click on <font color=green>OK</font> button
(or <font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font> to cancel the creation of a bundle).

<p>
If you selected the <b>Single Bits</b> option, then place and connect the
new bundling element.
If you selected the <b>Group Bits</b> option, then a new dialog will appear.

<p>
Pick a single wire position or a range of wire positions from the list on the
left.
To pick a range, select the first position in the range, the hold the shift
key when you select the last position in the range.
The entire range will then be highlighted. You can also hold the control key to
add specific wires to a range without selecting whole sections.

<p>
Now click on the "&gt;&gt;&gt;" button between the lists to move the selected
wire or wire range to the list on the right.
Note that when you do this, the positions in the left list are shown to be
<i>bundled</i>.
You will not be able to move an already bundled position to the the right list
again.

<p>
To remove a wire or wire range from the right list, select the one you want to
remove and click on the "&lt;&lt;&lt;" button.
Note that the position or positions removed are no longer shown as bundled
in the right list.

<p>
Once you have grouped everything you need into the right list, click on
<font color=green>OK</font> to place the element, or on
<font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font> to cancel the creation of the element.
