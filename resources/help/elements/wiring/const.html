<h1>Constant Values</h1>

<p>
An element that outputs a constant signal value (single or multiple bit) 
is created by selected the <img src=../../../edu/mtu/cs/jls/images/const.gif>
icon from the toolbar.

<p>
Select the radix (base) of the number entered in the "Value" box.
Then enter the desired constant value, using the selected base, either
by typing the value in the box or using the
<a href=../keypad>keypad</a>.

<p>
To set the value and radix to the same value/radix of the previously
created constant value element, click on
<font color=yellow>Repeat Previous Value</font>.

<p>
A constant element will adapt to the number of bits of the wire or element
it is connected to.
For example, if a constant element with value 109 is connected to an 8-bit
adder input, then the 8-bit binary equivalent of 109 will be output by the
constant element when the circuit it simulated.
If the number is too large to fit in the available wires, then the upper
bits are discarded.
For example, if the constant element with value 109<sub>10</sub> is connected
to a 4-bit adder input, then the lower four bits
(1101<sub>2</sub> = 13<sub> 10</sub>) will be sent to the adder.

<p>
To finish the dialog and place the newly created gate, click on the
<font color=green>OK</font> button.

<p>
If you change your mind and decide you don't want a gate of the type you
are currently creating, click on the <font color=pink>Cancel</font>
button in the dialog.
If you have already clicked on the <font color=green>OK</font> button but
have not yet fixed the place of the new gate, you can still cancel the gate
by right clicking the mouse.
