<h2>Creation</h2>

Pick either level,
{positive,leading,rising} edge or
{negative,trailing,falling} edge.

<p>
Enter the name of the register in the <b>Name</b> field.
This name must not be the same as the name of any other register or memory
element in the circuit.

<p>
A register is one or more latches/flip-flops, all triggered in the same way.
Set the number of bits in the register by entering a number in the <b>Bits</b>
field or using the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>.
A 1-bit register is essentially a single latch/flip-flip.

<p>
Give the register an initial value by entering a number in the
<b>Initial value</b> field or using the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>.
Only positive numbers can be entered.

<p>
The number shown as you enter it will be interpreted to be in the
radix (base) currently selected by one of the radix buttons.
For example, if "2" is selected, then the number you enter as an initial
value must be a binary number, and will be intrepreted as being so.
If fact, if "2" is selected, you will not be allowed to enter anything
other than a binary number.

<p>
Click on the <font color=green>OK</b> button to begin placing the register,
or on <font color=pink>Cancel</font> to cancel it.

<h2>Viewing Contents</h2>

<p>
When simulation stops or is paused the contents of a register can be
viewed by moving the cursor over it.
The contents will be displayed in the <font color=cyan>cyan</font> display
area below the toolbar.
The contents will be shown in hexadecimal and as an unsigned and a signed
base 10 integer.

<p>
The contents of a register can also be shown as a signal trace during
simulation.
To make this happen, right click in the register and chose the
<b>Watch Element</b> menu option.
