<h1>State Machine</h1>

<p>
A state machine is a collection of states, outputs from those states and
transitions from state to state.

<p>
Draw a state machine by drawing <a href=states.html>states</a>, the
<a href=transitions.html>transitions</a> between them, and the
<a href=outputs.html>outputs</a> from the states.

<p>
The state machine is simulated by an imaginary state register.
This register is edge triggered, so pick the edge you want this
state machine to be triggered on.

<p>
Give the state machine a name.
This name must not be the same as the name of any other element (e.g.,
register, memory) in the circuit.

<p>
Click on <font color=green>ok</font> to begin placing the state machine
in the circuit or on <font color=pink>cancel</font> to cancel the creation
of the state machine.

<p>
<a href=../../editor/editting/picking.html>Place</a> the state element in the
circuit.

<p>
The drawing area for the state machine can be increased by 10% by
clicking on the plus sign at the lower right corner of the drawing area.
