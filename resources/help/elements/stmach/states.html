<h1>States</h1>

<p>
Create a new state by right-clicking the mouse.
When the dialog pops up, give it a name.
It cannot be the same as any other state name in this state machine.
Click on <font color=green>ok</font> to begin placing the state.
Click on <font color=pink>cancel</font> to cancel the creation of the new state.

<p>
Place the state by moving the mouse to the desired position and left clicking.
Right click to cancel the creation of the state.

<p>
The first state created is by default the initial state when simulation begins.
Make a different state be the initial state by right clicking on the new
initial state and selecting <b>make initial state</b> from the menu that
pops up.
The state with a gray background is the initial state.

<p>
Move a state by pressing the left mouse button when the cursor is on the
state, dragging the state to its new position, then releasing the mouse button.

<p>
Rename a state by pressing the left mouse button when the cursor is on the
state, selecting <b>change name</b>, enter a new name, then click on
<font color=green>ok</font> to make the change, click on
<font color=pink>cancel</font> to cancel the change.
It cannot be the same as any other state name in this state machine.

<p>
Delete a state by pressing the left mouse button when the cursor is on the
state and selecting <b>delete state(s)</b>.
When a state is deleted, all transitions and outputs from that state are
deleted.

<p>
A group of states can be moved as a group.
Select the states to be moved by putting the cursor in an empty area left/right
and above/below the states, holding down the left mouse button, drawing
out a rectangle that encloses the desired states, and then releasing the mouse
button.
Move the cursor into the resulting rectangle, hold down the left mouse button,
drag the states to a new location, then release the mouse button.
All transitions between selected states will move with the states.

<p>
A group of states can be aligned either horizontally or vertically.
Select the states to be aligned (see above), then right click in the
selection rectangle and pick the type of alignment desired.
Alignment will not be performed if it causes the aligned states to overlap
other states or themselves.
