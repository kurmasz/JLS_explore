<h1>Creating an Adder</h1>

<p>
An adder can add an arbitrary number of bits, along with a carry into
the low order bit position, and generate the sum and a carry from the
high order bit.

<p>
The propagation delay of the adder is proportional to the number of
bits added.
It essentially simulates a simple ripple carry adder.

<p>
Set the number of bits being added by entering a number or using the keypad.
