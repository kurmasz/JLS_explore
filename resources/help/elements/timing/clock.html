<h1>Creating a Clock</h1>

<p>
A clock is an element whose output cycles between 0 and 1 forever.
You can set the cycle time (the time between consecutive 0 to 1, or 1 to 0
transitions), and also set the time the clock outputs a 1 (versus 0).

<p>
Set the cycle time by typing a number in the <b>Cycle Time</b> field or via
the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>.

<p>
Set the length of time the clock output should be 1 by typing a number in
the <b>One Time</b> field or via the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>.
The one time must be less than the cycle time.

<p>
Click on <font color=green>OK</font> to begin placing the clock, on
<font color=pink>Cancel</font> to cancel it.
