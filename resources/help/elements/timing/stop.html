<h1>Creating a Stop Element</h1>

<p>
A stop element causes the simulator to terminate (immediately) when its single
input becomes true (1).

<p>
When placing a stop element, connect any one of its four inputs to another
element or a wire.
When you do, the other three inputs will disappear.

<p>
You may have more than one stop element in a circuit.
