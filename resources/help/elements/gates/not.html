<h1>NOT Gate</h1>

<p>
By default a single NOT gate is created, with each input being a single wire.
Multiple NOT gates, with the input being a bundle of wires, can also be
specified by typing or using the <a href=../keypad.html>keypad</a>
to enter the desired number of gates in the "Gates (bits)" field.
The resulting single gate symbol will then be a shorthand for multiple
NOT gates, with the input of each gate being the corresponding bit position
from each wire in the input bundle.
For example, specifying two gates (bits) will produce the equivalent of
two gates (one symbol), with the input of one of the gates being from bit
position 0 of the input wire bundle and the input of the other gate being
from bit position 1 of the input wire bundle.

<p>
A NOT gate can point in any of four directions: up, down, left or right.
Pointing right (the default) means that the output of the gate is to the
right of the inputs.
Select the orientation of the gate you are creating by clicking on the
appropriately labelled button.

<p>
<p>
The characteristics of a new gate can be copied from the previously created
gate of the same type by clicking on 
<font color=yellow>Repeat Previous NOT Gate</font>.

<p>
To finish the dialog and place the newly created gate, click on the
<font color=green>OK</font> button.
Then move the mouse to position the gate where you want it in the circuit
and left click to fix it in that position (it can be moved later, so don't
have to be in exactly the right spot).

<p>
If you change your mind and decide you don't want a gate of the type you
are currently creating, click on the <font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font>
button in the dialog.
If you have already clicked on the <font color=green>OK</font> button but
have not yet fixed the place of the new gate, you can still cancel the gate
by right clicking the mouse.
