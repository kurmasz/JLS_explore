<h1>Gates</h1>

<p>
JLS supports
<a href=and.html>AND</a>,
<a href=or.html>OR</a>,
<a href=not.html>NOT</a>,
<a href=nand.html>NAND</a>,
<a href=nor.html>NOR</a>,
and <a href=xor.html>XOR</a> gates,
<a href=tristate.html>tri-state buffers</a>,
and <a href=delay.html>signal delays</a>.
All are created in basically the same way.
Click on the appropriate icon on the tool bar, or right click when the mouse
is in an empty area of the circuit drawing area, select "elements" from the
pop-up menu, and then select the appropriate icon.
A dialog box will appear in which various parameters of the gate can be
specified.

<p>
Most gates support multiple inputs (e.g., a three input AND gate).
Type the desired number of inputs in the "Inputs" field, or use a pop-up
<a href=keypad.html>keypad</a> to click in the number.

<p>
All gates can be specified as a single gate, with each input being a single
wire.
Multiple gates, with each input being a bundle of wires, can also be specified
by typing or keying the desired number of wires each input bundle in the
"Gates (bits)" field.

<p>
Most gates can point in any of four directions: up, down, left or right.
Pointing right (the default) means that the output of the gate is to the
right of the gate.
Select the orientation of the gate you are creating by clicking on the
appropriately labelled button.

<p>
The characteristics of most new gate types can be copied from the previously
created gate of the same type by clicking on the <font color=yellow>Repeat
Previous <i>type</i> Gate</font> button.

<p>
To finish the dialog and place the newly created gate, click on the
<font color=green>OK</font> button.
Then move the mouse to position the gate where you want it in the circuit
and left click to fix it in that position (it can be moved later, so don't
have to be in exactly the right spot).

<p>
If you change your mind and decide you don't want a gate of the type you
are currently creating, click on the <font color=fuchsia>Cancel</font>
button in the dialog.
If you have already clicked on the <font color=green>OK</font> button but
have not yet fixed the place of the new gate, you can still cancel the gate
by right clicking the mouse.
