<h1>Batch Simulation</h1>

<p>
When JLS is run in batch (non-GUI) mode,
a circuit file is loaded, the simulator run, and then the final contents
of any watched elements (registers, memories) are printed to the standard
output.

<p>
Simulation stops when there are no more events, a <i>stop</i> element in
the circuit gets a 1 input, or the time limit is reached.

<p>
Watched register contents are printed in three ways: hexadecimal, unsigned
decimal and signed (two's complement) decimal.

<p>
Only those words of a watched memory element that are different at the
end of simulation than they were at the beginning of simulation are printed,
showing both the initial value and final value.
