<h1>Interactive Simulation</h1>

<p>
When run in the interactive mode the simulator simulates the operation of the
circuit currently visible in the editting window.
If the visible circuit is a subcircuit of another circuit,
then the simulator will simulate the entire circuit the subcircuit is in.

<p>
The simulator can be visible or not when running.
To make it visible, select the <a href=../../menus/sim/show.html>Show</a>
item in the <b>Simulator</b> menu;
select the <a href=../../menus/sim/hide.html>Hide</a>
item in the <b>Simulator</b> menu to hide it.
When first shown, the signal trace area is not displayed.
To see it, drag the divider between the editting window and the simulation
window up.

<p>
If the simulator is not visible when started (i.e., via the menu), then a
yellow simulator bar will appear below the editting window.
It will show the current state of the simulation (e.g., running, stopped)
and the number of time units that have been simulated so far.
To stop it prematurely, use the <a href=../../menus/sim/stop.html>stop</a>
item from the <b>Simulator</b> menu.

<p>
A visible simulator window allows more control over the execution of the
simulator (e.g., stepping by various time amounts) and allows you to see
a trace of various signal and element values versus time.
Simulation can be started via the <a href=start.html>start</a> button,
paused via the <a href=pause.html>pause</a> button,
resumed via the <a href=resume.html>resume</a> button,
stopped via the <a href=stop.html>stop</a> button,
stepped by some number of time units via the 
<a href=step.html>step</a> button,
and animated via the <a href=animate.html>animate</a> button.

<p>
The <b>Start</b> button only works when the simulation is stopped.
If it is being stepped or has been paused, clicking on <b>Start</b> has
no effect.
However, a stepped or paused simuation can be resumed, or a paused simulation
stepped.

<p>
When the simulation stops, finishes a step, or pauses,
wires that have the value 0 are shown in <b>black</b>
and wires that have non-zero values are shown in
<b><font color=red>red</font></b>.
Signal traces are also updated.
The actual value on any wire can be displayed in the
<font color=cyan>cyan</font> message area above the circuit by moving the
cursor over the wire.
Register values can be seen analogously.
The contents of a memory element can be displayed by right clicking on the
element and picking the <b>View Contents</b> item from the menu that pops up.

<p>
Signal traces can be printed by clicking on the <b>Print</b> button.
A dialog box will appear in which you can specify various printing
parameters.
