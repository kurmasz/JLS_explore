<h1>Simulator Animate Button</h1>

<p>
The animate button will cause simulation to repeat the <a href=step.html>step</a> command
once per second until one of the following occurs:

<ul>
<li> the <b>end</b> button is pushed,
<li> no signals will change within the simulated circuit,
<li> the simulation time limit is reached,
<li> or the simulation stops or pauses as a result of the action of the <a href=../../elements/timing/stop.html>stop</a> or
     <a href=../../elements/timing/pause.html>pause</a> elements in the circuit.
</ul>

The amount of simulated time for each second of animation is controlled by the value
showing in the <b>Step</b> field.
This value can be changed any time the simulator is not running, with
the new value becoming the step amount for the next animation.
