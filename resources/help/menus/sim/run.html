<h1>Run the Simulator</h1>

<p>
Seleting this menu item will cause the currently visible circuit (or
the main circuit that a currently visible subcircuit is contained in)
to be initialized and simulated.

<p>
Simulation will continue until there no more output value changes are
possible or the currently set time limit is reached, whichever comes first.
When the simulation ends a yellow simulator bar will appear below the
circuit indicating the reason for stopping and the total simulation time.

<p>
Long running simulations (unexpected perhaps because of errors in the circuit
and too large a time limit) can be stopped by selecting the
<a href=stop.html>stop</a> menu item.
