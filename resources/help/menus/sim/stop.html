<h1>Stop a Running Simulation</h1>

<p>
If a simulation is running and you don't want to wait for it to end,
it can be stopped by selecting this menu item.

<p>
Usually you use this because you expected the simulation to have stopped
already, but it hasn't because of some error in the circuit and because
the simulation time limit is set too high.

<p>
The default time limit is 100,000,000 time units.
To change it, select the <a href=show.html>show</a> simulator menu item
and change the value in the time limit box at the top right of the simulation
window.
You can then <a href=hide.html>hide</a> the simulation window or simply
run the simulation again using the <b>Run</b> menu item or the
<font color=green>Restart</font> button at the far left of the simulation
window.
