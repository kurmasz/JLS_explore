<h1>New Circuit</h1>

<p>
Selecting this menu item creates a new, empty circuit ready to be edited.
It pops up a dialog box to prompt for a name.

<p>
A legal name consists of one or more letters, digits and underscore and
must begin with a letter.

<p>
The name must be unique among all circuits currently being editted.

<p>
The name is not expected to have a .jls extension that is normally used
when saving the circuit in a file (.jls is added automatically when the
circuit it saved).
However, if you put .jls at the end of your circuit name, then JLS will
remove it.
