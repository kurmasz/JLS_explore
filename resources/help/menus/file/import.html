<h1>Import from File</h1>

<p>
A circuit that has been saved in a file is imported into the circuit
currently being editted.
A file chooser will pop up allowing you to select the file you want to
import.
If you enter a circuit name without the .jls extension, .jls will be added
for you.
For example, if you enter "MySub", then JLS will try to import the
circuit in the file "MySub.jls".
