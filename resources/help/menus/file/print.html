<h1>Print Circuit</h1>

<p>
A paper copy of circuit currently being editted, all of its subcircuits
(recursively), all of its state machines and all of its truth table elements,
will be printed.
If a subcircuit is currently being editted, then the main circuit it is
a subcircuit of will be printed.

<p>
Each circuit/subcircuit will be printed on a separate sheet of paper.
Any state machine will appear on two sheets - one for the state machine,
another for a listing of the outputs of each state.
Any truth table element will be on a separate sheet.
All will be scaled to fit on the size of paper chosen.

<p>
A dialog box will appear that will allow you to pick the printer you want
the circuit to be printed on.
