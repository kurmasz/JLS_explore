<h1>Export Image of Circuit</h1>

<p>
An image (JPEG format) of the circuit or subcircuit currently visible will be 
created and written to a file.
The image will have the same resolution as the circuit on the screen.
It will be just large enough to contain the circuit elements plus a 10 pixel
border on all sides.

<p>
A file chooser dialog will pop up that will allow you to pick the name of
the file to save the image in.
The name must consist of letters, digits and underscore and it must begin
with a letter.
If the name you choose does not have the .jpg extension, JLS will add it.
