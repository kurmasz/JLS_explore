<h1>JLS Startup File</h1>

<p>
The JLS startup file is used to force various circuit properties when JLS is
run in batch mode.
The startup file is ignored if JLS is started up in interractive mode.

<ul>
<li>
Specify default propagation delays for any or all element types.
<pre>
    TYPE type PROPDELAY delay
</pre>
<p>
where <i>type</i> is one of
<b>
<code>AndGate</code>,
<code>OrGate</code>,
<code>NotGate</code>,
<code>XorGate</code>,
<code>NandGate</code>,
<code>NorGate</code>,
<code>DelayGate</code>,
<code>TriState</code>,
<code>Register</code>,
<code>Memory</code>,
<code>MUX</code>,
<code>Adder</code>,
<code>Decoder</code>,
</b>
and <i>delay</i> is a positive integer.
<li>
Make all elements in the circuit being loaded <i>unwatched</i>.
<pre>
    CLEAR WATCHES
</pre>
<li>
Remove all <i>probes</i> from the circuit being loaded.
<pre>
    CLEAR PROBES
</pre>
<li>
Reset all propagation delays to their default values in the circuit being
loaded.
<pre>
    RESET PROPDELAYS
</pre>
<li>
Specify that specifically named elements (registers,
memories, etc.) be <i>watched</i> or not.
<pre>
    ELEMENT <i>name</i> WATCHED true/false
</pre>
<p>
where <i>name</i> is the name of an element in the circuit and true/false
is either the word <code>true</code> or the word <code>false</code>.
If <i>name</i> is an element in a subcircuit, then the sequence of subcircuit
names starting with subcircuit in the main circuit must be used, with
periods between the names.
For example, if the main circuit has a subcircuit called "cache" and the
cache subcircuit has a subcircuit called "control" and the control subcircuit
has a register element called "tag", then the name of the tag register is
cache.control.tag.
<li>
Specify propagation delays for specifically named elements (registers,
memories, etc.).
<pre>
    ELEMENT <i>name</i> PROPDELAY value
</pre>
<p>
where <i>name</i> is the name of an element in the circuit and value is the
propagation delay (or access time in the case of a memory element) and
is a positive integer.
If <i>name</i> is an element in a subcircuit, then it must be qualified as
in the previous specification.
<li>
Specify initial values for specifically named registers.
<p>
<pre>
    ELEMENT <i>name</i> INITIALLY value
</pre>
<p>
where <i>name</i> is the name of a register element in the circuit and value
is the initial value for that register, a positive integer.
If <i>name</i> is an element in a subcircuit, then it must be qualified as
in the previous specification.
<li>
Specify the file name for specificially named memories to read their 
initial contents from.
<p>
<pre>
    ELEMENT <i>name</i> FILENAME filename
</pre>
<p>
where <i>name</i> is the name of a memory element in the circuit and filename
is the name of the file to read initial memory contents from when simulation
begins.
This overrides any builtin memory values.
If <i>name</i> is an element in a subcircuit, then it must be qualified as
in the previous specification.
</ul>

<p>
The parameter file is read in order and each specification is processed 
in order.
For example, to make exactly one register (say PC) be watched and everything
else not watched, first specify that all elements be unwatched, then make
the PC watched.

<p>
Note that all parameter file information is case sensitive.
Otherwise no special formatting is required, other than words and numbers must
be separated by white space (one or more spaces, tabs and/or new lines).
If any errors are encountered when JLS reads the parameter file, an error
message is printed and JLS terminates immediately.
