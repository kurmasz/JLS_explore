<h1>Running JLS </h1>

<p>
JLS is contained in a JAR (Java ARchive) file.
It can be run from a command line, or, depending on the operating system
and window manager, by clicking on an icon.
It runs in one of two modes:
<a href=../simulator/interactive/overview.html>interactive</a> (with GUI)
or
<a href= ../simulator/batch/overview.html>batch</a> (no GUI).
Interactive is the default.
Use the -b flag (see below) to run JLS in batch mode.

<p>
When run in the interactive mode, JLS will create a checkpoint file after
every 10 changes.
The name of the checkpoint file is the name of the circuit with ".jls~"
appended.
If JLS aborts and you are not able to save the circuit you are working on,
then you can recover the checkpointed state by renaming the checkpoint
file (delete the "~") and starting JLS again.

<h2>Command Line Execution</h2>
<p>
The basic command for starting JLS in interactive mode is:

<pre>
    java -jar JLS.jar
</pre>

This starts up JLS with no circuit in the editor.
The user can subsequently create a new circuit or open an existing circuit.

<p>
If a circuit file name is specified on the command line then JLS will start up
with the circuit already loaded in the editor, e.g.

<pre>
    java -jar JLS.jar <i>circuit.jls</i>
</pre>

To run JLS in batch mode type

<pre>
    java -jar JLS.jar <i>-b</i> circuit.jls
</pre>

<p>
(note that a circuit file must be specified when -b is used)

<h2>Icon Startup</h2>
<p>
The mechanism for starting JLS by clicking on an icon is dependent on the
particular operating system and window manager.
While the details differ, most allow the icon to be parameterized in such
a way as to allow the various command line options to be specified.

<h2>Flags</h2>

<p>
<b>-b</b>
Batch mode.

<p>
<b>-dtime</b>
Set the simulation time limit.
The time is a positive integer immediately following <b>-d</b>, e.g.,
-d1000.

<p>
<b>-h</b>
Print a short help message.

<p>
<b>-sname</b>
Read JLS <a href=startup.html>start-up</a> file before loading any circuits.
The name of the file immediately follows the <b>-s</b>, e.g.,
-sparameters.
Any legal file name not containing spaces is allowed.

<p>
<b>-tname</b>
Read JLS <a href=../elements/other/sigformat.html>test input</a>
file just before simulating a circuit.
The file will be read every time the simulator is started, so changes
made to the file will affect a subsequent simulation run.
The name of the file immediately follows the <b>-t</b>, e.g.,
-tinputsigs.
Any legal file name not containing spaces is allowed.

<p>
<b>-pprinter</b>
When used with batch mode causes the entire circuit to be printed.
If a printer name is present, the output will be sent to it.

<p>
<b>-vprinter</b>
When used with batch mode causes the top level of the circuit to be printed (no subcircuits).
If a printer name is present, the output will be sent to it.

<p>
<b>-rprinter</b>
Forces batch mode, runs the simulator, and prints the signal trace to the named printer.
