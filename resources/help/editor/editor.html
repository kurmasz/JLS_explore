<p>
The editor allows you to draw complete circuits.
All drawing can be done via the mouse and mouse buttons (both left and
right).
Many actions result in a pop-up menu of options appearing
(e.g., cut/copy/paste).
<a href=editing/hotkeys.html>Keyboard accelerators</a> can be used in place
of menu selections.
