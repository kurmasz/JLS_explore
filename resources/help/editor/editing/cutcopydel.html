<h1>Cut/Copy/Delete</h1>

A single item (element, wire, wire corner) or a collection of items can be
cut, copied or deleted from the circuit.
Cutting item(s) removes them from the circuit and puts them on the clipboard.
Copying item(s) make a copy of them on the clipboard.
Items on the clipboard can then be <a href=paste.html>pasted</a> into the
circuit they were taken from or into any other circuit.
Deleting item(s) simply removes them from the circuit with no change to the
clipboard.

delete.
Simply pick the desired option.
