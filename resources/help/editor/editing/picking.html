<h1>Picking and Placing Elements</h1>

<p>
To add a new element to the circuit, click on the appropriate element
icon on the toolbar.
A dialog box will open up that will allow you to customize the element.
Once customized, click on the OK button in the dialog box to begin placing
the element in the circuit.
If you decide that you don't want the element, click on the cancel button.
For help with the customization options for the element, click on the help
button.

<p>
Once you've customized the element and clicked the ok button, use the
mouse to move the element to the place in the circuit you want it to be.
Note the informational message at the right of the blue message bar under
the elements tool bar.
As you see, you can fix the place of the element by clicking the left mouse
button, and you can still cancel the element by clicking on the right mouse
button.

<p>
New elements cannot be placed anywhere.
All elements have a rectangular <i>bounding box</i> that must not overlap
with the bounding box of any other element.
This bounding box is shown in pink while you are placing the new element, and
will disappear when the element is finally placed.

<p>
When you are moving a new element around the circuit, notice the red message
that sometimes appears in the middle of the blue message bar.
This message indicates that the element cannot be placed where it currently
is shown in the circuit.
When there is no message showing, the element may be placed.

<p>
There are a few simple rules about placing elements.

<ol>
<li>
Elements can not overlap other elements.
<li>
Outputs of elements cannot be connected either to other element outputs or
to wires that are connected to other element outputs, <i>unless</i> all outputs
are tri-stated.
<li>
Inputs or outputs of elements cannot connect to inputs or outputs or wires that
have differing number of bits.
Constant elements assume the number of bits of the thing they are connected
to, so this rule doesn't apply to them.
</ol>

<p>
If you left click to place an element where it is not allowed, the left
click will be ignored.
You must either move the element to an allowable place and then left click,
or you must cancel the element by right clicking.

<p>
You can still move an element after it has been placed.
See <a href=moving.html>moving elements/wires</a> for an explaination.
