<h1>Selecting Multiple Elements/Wires</h1>

<p>
You can select multiple items (elements, wire segments, wire corners) then
<a href=moving.html>move</a> them,
<a href=cutcopydel.html>cut, copy or delete</a> them,
or <a href=lock.html>lock</a> them.

<p>
To select multiple items, move the cursor to an open area of the circuit,
press the left mouse button, drag out a rectangle that encloses the items you
want to <i>select</i>, and then release the button.
The selection rectangle will appear in light gray while you are dragging.
As the rectangle encloses an item, the pink bounding rectangle for that item
will appear (wire segments will become pink, and wire corners will appear
as pink circles).
When the mouse button is released a darker gray rectangle will indicate
the smallest rectangle that encloses the selected items.
You can now move them, cut, copy or delete them, or lock them.
