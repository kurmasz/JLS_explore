<h1>Pasting from the Clipboard</h1>

<p>
Items cut or copied to the clipboard (even from other circuits) can be pasted
into the circuit currently being edited.
To do so, move the cursor to an open area of the circuit and click the
right mouse button.
A menu will appear with paste as one of the options.
Pick that option.
The menu will disappear, the items on the clipboard will appear, ready
to be <a href=placing.html>placed</a>.

<p>
You can also type the ctrl-V key to paste the contents of the clipboard
as long as the cursor is somewhere in the circuit editing area.
