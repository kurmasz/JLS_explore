<h1>Overview of JLS</h1>

<p>
JLS is a powerful digital logic simulation tool created primarily for
educational use.
It includes a graphical <a href=editor/editor.html>editor</a> that allows
users to create and modify logic circuits,
and a <a href=simulator/simulator.html>simulator</a> that will show the
operation of the circuit.
It also has many features that are useful for classroom instruction
and for the grading of student-designed circuits.

<p>
Logic circuits can contain the standard gate types:
AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, tri-state buffer 
and logically neutral time delay element;
composite elements:
decoder, multiplexor, and adder;
memory elements:
registers, SRAM, and ROM;
a clock and various mechanisms for connecting gates and elements via
wires and wiring elements.
State machines can be created by using JLS's
<a href=elements/stmach/stmach.html>state machine editor</a>.
Combinational circuitry specified by a truth table can be generated by
using JLS's <a href=elements/truth/truth.html>truth table editor</a>.

<p>
Circuits can include copies of other circuits (subcircuits), nested to an
arbitrary depth.
Circuits can be printed or exported as image (JPEG) files.
